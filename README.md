# RxJs-In-Practice

## This Course in a Nutshell (note: this course includes the Typescript Jumpstart E-Book)

This course is a complete practical guide for the RxJs library (Reactive Extensions for Javascript).

If you are a developer just getting started with the Angular ecosystem, or even if you already have some experience with it, the part that you will find the hardest to wrap your head around is RxJs.

And this is because RxJs and Reactive Programming have a steep learning curve that makes it hard to just jump in into an existing program and learn these concepts by example. With RxJs that approach will simply not work. Instead, we need to start at the beginning and learn some baseline reactive design concepts first.

In this course, we will start by presenting a couple of baseline concepts, and then we will provide you with an extended catalog of RxJs operators that will in practice cover the vast majority of your daily needs.

Also, the goal here is not to cover every single operator, but instead to choose an extended subset that contains the most commonly used operators, and provide practical examples for each.

Another goal of the course is to show how RxJs is meant to be used for building programs using Reactive Design as opposed to an imperative programming style.
